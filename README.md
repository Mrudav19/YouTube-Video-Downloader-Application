YouTube Video Downloader Application

I developed a YouTube Video Downloader application in Python using Tkinter and the pytube library, enabling users to download videos from YouTube. Here's an overview of the application's features and functionalities:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   - Created a Tkinter window with labels, entry fields, and buttons for user interaction.
   - Provided options for users to paste the video link and select the desired video quality.

2. Video Downloading:
   - Utilized the pytube library to fetch video streams from YouTube based on the provided link and selected quality.
   - Supported downloading videos in various resolutions, including the highest available resolution and specific resolutions like 720p, 480p, etc.

3. Download Process:
   - Prompted users to select a destination directory for saving the downloaded video.
   - Handled exceptions and displayed appropriate error messages if the download encountered any issues.

4. User Feedback:
   - Notified users about the download status with messages indicating success or displaying error messages if any issues occurred.

5. Main Functionality:
   - Defined a main function to initialize the Tkinter window and the YouTubeDownloaderApp instance.
   - Launched the Tkinter event loop to handle user interactions and application events.

This YouTube Video Downloader application demonstrates my proficiency in GUI development with Tkinter and integrating external libraries for enhanced functionality.
